Classes:
PUnit: This class represents a node in the priority tree. 
It has a URL, parent, and a list of children units.
The parent of the seed URL is null. Randoms have been removed.
The searches are designed to traverse the entire tree before an
element is returned

Priority Tree: This class represents a tree where the children 
of any node are the links pointed in the page of the node's URL.
Every tree has a seed and a size.

WebCrawler2: This is the crawling program that accepts 3 arguments:
Seed URL, maxSize and bfs. If the 3rd argument is bfs, searches will
be breadth-first, else they will be depth-first.
